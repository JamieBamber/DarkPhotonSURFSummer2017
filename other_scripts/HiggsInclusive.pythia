! This file contains commands to be read in for a Pythia8 run. 
! Lines not beginning with a letter or digit are comments.

! 1) Settings that could be used in a main program, if desired.
Main:numberOfEvents = 1000       ! number of events to generate
Main:timesAllowErrors = 30         ! max number of allowed errors

! 2) LHC beams parameter settings. 
Beams:idA = 2212                   ! first beam, p = 2212, pbar = -2212
Beams:idB = 2212                   ! second beam, p = 2212, pbar = -2212
Beams:eCM = 13000.                 ! CM energy of collision

! 3) Settings for the hard-process generation
HiggsSM:all = on

# tho switch on one process only, switch off all of them... 
# HiggsSM:all = off
# ... and then on what you need
# HiggsSM:ffbar2HZ = on
# HiggsSM:ffbar2HW = on
# HiggsSM:gg2Httbar = on
# HiggsSM:qqbar2Httbar = on

# switch off all decay modes
25::onMode = off
# switch on only H->gamma gamma
25:onIfMatch = 22 22
